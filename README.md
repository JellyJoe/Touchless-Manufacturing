#Arm
This branch contains the code sketches for the automating or manual movement of the robotic arm.

##Requirements
Arduino IDE is required to upload the code to the robotic arm.

##Installation
1. Download Arduino IDE (Download Link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

2. Import the uArm Library (search uArmLibrary) using Library Manager. If you are unsure about how to use Library Manager. Please Refer to this link (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3)

3. Once you finish importing the library , you are now able to upload the auto or manual script depending on your choice to the arm. If you unsure about how to upload Arduino sketch, We recommend you to refer to this link (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)

Alternatively, visit this link to learn about the installation process of the IDE and also on how to upload the sketch to the robotic arm.
