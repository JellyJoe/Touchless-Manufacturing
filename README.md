#Pixy
This branch contains the code sketches and a driver program to test out the functionality of it.
Pixy library file is NOT included in the Arduino IDE itself, have to install it manually into the Arduino IDE.
After completing the installation of the Pixy's library into Arduino IDE, then hook up the Pixy Camera to the Arduino.
BE CAREFULL WHEN HOOKING UP PIXY CAMERA WITH ARDUINO! Please read the details given below first, then ONLY do the hooking up.
After hooking up, you can now test this branch codes. 
Signature has to be set using PixyMon. This branch code has set for allowing 1 block to be detected for Signature number 1 only. Adjustment needed to be made for multiple blocks.

##Installation
###Installation of Arduino IDE
Download from this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

###Installation of PixyMon and Pixy Library
Download from this link: http://cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5/wiki/Latest_release
PixyMon is a software for user to view what is Pixy sees. It provide configuration and teaches how Pixy sees.
