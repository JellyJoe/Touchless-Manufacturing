#Report
This branch holds the codes for the reporting functionalities of the application.
However, most of the code are outdated as it has to be modified to fit the needs of the application (such as using slots and signals).

##Usage
Change the terminal directory to this, type 'make' in the terminal and followed by './Driver' to test out the functions of it using Linux.

##External Libraries
The functions would not be possible without the use of TinyXML2.
